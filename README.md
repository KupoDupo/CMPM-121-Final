# Devlog Entry - [11/13]

## Introducing the team
**Tools Lead:** Nathan G  
**Engine Lead:** Loisel K  
**Design Lead:** Izzy S  
**Testing Lead:** Romeo M  

## Tools and materials
**Engine:** We will be using the LÖVE engine because it works well with Lua, the language we want to use, and is a popular tool for 2D game development. Professor Smith also mentioned that it is a popular engine and easier alternative to Unity.

**Language:** We plan on using the Lua coding language for our project since it's well respected in the game development community and would be a good skill for us to pick up. It also works well with the LÖVE engine.  
<https://www.lua.org/>  

**Tools:** Our primary coding environment will be Visual Studio Code & Codespace with the Lua extension. We are all familiar with this environment, as we used VS Code and Codespace for past experiences and assignments. If we need to use more external tools later into our project, VS code and Codespace offers these tools as extensions.

**Generative AI:** We are okay using copilot on our project, including the autocomplete features and the coding agent. Even though we will be using Generative AI, we will still be overviewing all code created to make sure we understand what was created.    


## Outlook
Lua is a new language to all of us so we're hoping to pick up on that quickly and be able to become relatively familiar with a new tool we can use to design games. The LÖVE engine that works with Lua is also new to us so the same applies. Lua and LÖVE are both highly used in the indie game dev community so we want to get some practical experience with them. Since none of us have any experience with these tools the whole idea of creating a game with them is a little bit of a risk since we have strict deadlines (and grades) associated with them. Our idea for the game is pretty basic/mainstream but it's something we wanted to try implementing.  

## Game Overview - Spooky Puzzle Escape Room
Our game will be a top-down escape room style puzzle where you are trapped in a haunted house. You must sneak around the house and solve puzzles to find your way out.
